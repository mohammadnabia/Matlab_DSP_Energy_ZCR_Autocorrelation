# Matlab_DSP_Energy_ZCR_Autocorrelation-
In this repository, we first read the file of a signal in Matlab and then calculate for that signal the energy value of the short time, the magnitude of the short time, and the Zero crossing rate on the short time. After seeing the output of the above values, we check the autocorrelation for vowels and non-vowels in our selected part of the file.
